Hey there! I'm Buddhsen Tripathi, working as Software Development Engineer for Amadeus (July'21) and graduated from Vellore Institute of Technology in Bachelor of Technology in 2023. My journey into the world of technology began with a curiosity for how internet works and a drive to create innovative solutions to everyday problems.

Beyond coding and debugging, I love exploring new technologies, doodling concepts in Microsoft Paint, and occasionally diving into cybersecurity challenges.

During my time at VIT, I noticed a gap: while students focused on advanced topics, essential core concepts for placements and real-world applications were often overlooked.

This blog is my response to that gap. Here, I aim to bridge theory with practice by diving deep into fundamental topics crucial for starting a successful career in tech. From implementing data structures and algorithms to mastering operating systems and cybersecurity, I'll break down complex concepts into clear, practical insights.

These topics would be covered in this series of blog:

* Data Structures and Algorithms
    
* Operating Systems
    
* Database Management Systems
    
* Networking Fundamentals
    
* Cybersecurity Basics
    
* Software Engineering Principles
    
* Web Development Essentials
    
* Programming Paradigms
    
* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
    

Thanks for joining me on this tech adventure. Stay tuned for more insights on core CS topics. Feel free to connect with me on social media, share feedback, and let's build a solid foundation together!
